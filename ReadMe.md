Plasma Reddit Wallpaper plugin 

Greatly inspired by https://github.com/Zren/plasma-wallpapers

In config : 

* choose a subreddit (pick one with many pictures like EarthPorn for example otherwise no pic can be fetched)
* choose the delay between two wallpapers change
* and that should be it

The picture or thread title is displayed at the bottom, to have informations about the picture.
